# CNSLAB
1. Implement Caesar Cipher encryption & Decryption technique which is by replacing each character by another character that will be some fixed number of positions down to it.
2. Demonstrate the playfair cipher, consider the key table 5Ã—5 grid of alphabets that acts as the key for encrypting the plaintext.
3. Implement Data encryption and decryption using Hill Cipher method.
4. Encrypt the plaintext we using a Vigenere table that consists of the alphabet from A to Z written out 26 times in different rows, further each alphabet must be shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet.
5. Implement Rail fence cipher technique using the row & Column Transformation.
6. Demonstrate the Simplified Data Encryption Standard based on the two fundamental attributes of cryptography: substitution (also called as confusion) and transposition (also called as diffusion).
7. Execute the program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data.
8. Implement diffie Hellman (DH) key exchange algorithm as a method for securely exchanging cryptographic keys over a public communications channel.
